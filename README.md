# Waste-Management-by-Chitra-Julie

Project Name: 
Taking Care of Rubbish

Overview:

This project is datasets from the UK and England about waste generated, imported, exported, and treatments to get a better understanding on how much trash is being produced. Our goal is educate ourselves and others.

Questions:

1. What does the trash generated look like on a global ranking?
2. Is there any correlation between certain demographic points and waste produced? If so, what is the amount of produced waste for what population, and what is the average income for that population?
3. Did time show any significance? If so, whatâ€™s the overall amount of waste generated over time in England?
4. What are the relationships between the different waste types, classifications*, and treatment methods for both the UK and England?
5. How do treatment methods differ by waste types?
